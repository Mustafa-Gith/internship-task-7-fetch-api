# Task 7 – Fetch and Display Data from a Public API

This project is part of my internship tasks. It uses the **JavaScript Fetch API** to get a list of users from a public API and display it on a webpage.

## 🌐 What It Does

- Fetches user data from: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
- Displays each user's:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Address
- Handles errors (e.g., network offline)
- Includes a "Reload Data" button to fetch the data again

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – structure of the page
- `style.css` – basic styling for layout and user cards
- `script.js` – fetch logic, DOM updates, and error handling

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. It will automatically fetch and display users
3. You can click **"Reload Data"** to refresh the list

## 📌 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Fetch API
- JSONPlaceholder API

## 🙋‍♂️ Why This Task?

This task helped me practice:
- Making HTTP requests with `fetch()`
- Handling JSON responses
- Dynamically updating the DOM
- Catching and displaying errors to the user
